                You get a flat, and under the carpet in the trunk is one of
                those "donut" (or "temporary") spare tires â€“ skinnier than the
                tires on your car, with a prominent warning about maximum speed
                on the side. You're probably wondering how long you can drive on
                it before you get your other tire repaired at a reputable shop.
                We're here to help. The best place to start is your owner's
                manual, which should list the exact recommended mileage for the
                spare tire. If you don't have a manual, 70 miles is the rule of
                thumb. These tires are not designed for long-range service. They
                are made to get you to a garage to have your tire either
                repaired or replaced. Driving on it for an extended period of
                time under regular driving conditions will result in a blowout
                in short order, so get a safe tire on your car immediately.
                Maybe you can find a reasonably priced used tire if it has to be
                replaced.
